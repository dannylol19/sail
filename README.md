# sail
Simple Assembly Inspired Language (SAIL) is a very barebones assembly language inspired by the x86 assembly language.
Currently the repo has code for the virtual machine to run sail bytecode. Goals: Finish designing language (add more instructions, add more functionality like ascii strings etc..), and implement an assembler to assemble sail assembly into sail bytcode.
